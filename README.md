<h2>Simple JavaScript Pokedex App</h2>
<p>The application loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of 120 different 
    Pokémon with their detail. The Application was built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, 
    jQuery using Bootstrap to manage tzhe UI</p>

<h3>Onjective</h3>
  <p>To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data 
  from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.
  </p>

<h3>Contact Page</h3>
  <p>This page shows my contact information which include Telephone, Email and a contact form.
  </p>

<h3>Context</h3>
  <p>The best way to learn about programming is to complete a project using that     
      programming language. Therefore this is my first project to deploy the JavaScript languiage to interract with an external data source. In this case the external source is the Pokedex application website.
  </p>

<h3>User Goals</h3>
  <p>Users should be able to view a list of data (Pokemon) and see more details for a given data (Pokemon) item on demand.  
  </p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<p> ● Load data from an external source (API)
    ● View a list of items
    ● On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item
</p>

<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p>Required:
    ● The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
    ● The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
    ● The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
      demand, such as when clicking on a list item.<br>
    ● The app must have CSS styling.
    ● The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
    ● The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
    ● The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
    ● The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for
      details or touch interactions.<br>
    ● The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
    ● The app must not throw any errors when being used.
    ● The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you
      can review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code <br>
      Quality, Testing, & Web Hosting).
    ● The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
    ● The app should show loading indicators while loading data.
